# Install IPFS

You can install the [Go IPFS implementation](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs)
from source or from prebuilt packages.


## Prebuilt Packages

We use [gobuilder.me](https://gobuilder.me) to do automated builds.

Download a binary for your platform (more coming):

- <i class="fa fa-apple"></i> [Mac OS X](https://gobuilder.me/get/github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/cmd/ipfs/ipfs_master_darwin-amd64.zip)
- <i class="fa fa-linux"></i> [Linux x86](https://gobuilder.me/get/github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/cmd/ipfs/ipfs_master_linux-386.zip)
- <i class="fa fa-linux"></i> [Linux x86_64](https://gobuilder.me/get/github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/cmd/ipfs/ipfs_master_linux-amd64.zip)
- <i class="fa fa-linux"></i> [Linux ARM](https://gobuilder.me/get/github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/cmd/ipfs/ipfs_master_linux-arm.zip)
- [See all builds](http://gobuilder.me/github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/cmd/ipfs)

Then, unzip the archive, and move `ipfs` somewhere in your `$PATH`:

```
mv ipfs /usr/local/bin/ipfs
```

Test it out:

```
> ipfs version
ipfs version 0.2.0
```

That's it!

Note: if you're concerned about security, build from source, as either
[gobuilder.me](https://gobuilder.me) or [github.com](https://github.com)
could introduce vulnerabilites. We will be doing signed releases soon.
[Post here](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/957) if you'd like this
sooner.

## From Source

Dependencies:

- [Install Go 1.4](https://golang.org/doc/install) (to compile. [make sure it's 1.4](docs/install#check-go-version))
- [Install Git](http://git-scm.com/) (to download dependencies)
- *Optionally*, install [FUSE](docs/install#install-fuse) (for mounting / advanced use)

Then run:

```sh
go get -u github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/cmd/ipfs
```

This will download ipfs and its dependencies, and compile `ipfs` (Make sure to add `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`). Test it out:

```
> ipfs version
ipfs version 0.2.0
```

That's it!

### Troubleshooting

#### Help!

If you have any problems, come get live help at
[#ipfs](docs/#community) or via [the mailing list](docs/#community).

#### Check Go Version

IPFS works with Go 1.4+.
To check what go version you have installed, type `go version`.
Here's what I get:

```sh
> go version
go version go1.4.1 darwin/amd64
```

If you need to update, it is recommended to install from the
[canonical Go packages](https://golang.org/doc/install/).
Package managers often contain out-of-date Go packages.

#### Install FUSE

For more details on setting up FUSE (so that you can mount the filesystem), see [github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/fuse.md](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/fuse.md)
