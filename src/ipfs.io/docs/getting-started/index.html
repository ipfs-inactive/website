# Getting Started

If you haven't done so, [install ipfs](../install).

During this tutorial, if you have any questions, feel free to ask them in [ipfs/support](https://github.com/ipfs/support) or in [#ipfs on chat.freenode.net](irc://chat.freenode.net/%23ipfs).

## init the repo

`ipfs` uses a global local object repository, added to `~/.ipfs`:

```sh
> ipfs init
initializing ipfs node at /Users/jbenet/.go-ipfs
generating 2048-bit RSA keypair...done
peer identity: Qmcpo2iLBikrdf1d6QU6vXuNb6P7hwrbNPW9kLAH8eG67z
to get started, enter:

  ipfs cat /ipfs/QmYwAPJzv5CZsnA625s3Xf2nemtYgPpHdWEz79ojWnPbdG/readme

```

<div class="alert alert-info">
Note the hash there may differ. If it does, use the one you got.

Your `peer identity` is your unique identity on the `ipfs` network,
so you may not want to publish it on the net together with your `real`
identity, since then all files you publish can potentially be tracked
back to you.
</div>

Now, try running:

```sh
ipfs cat /ipfs/QmYwAPJzv5CZsnA625s3Xf2nemtYgPpHdWEz79ojWnPbdG/readme
```

You should see something like this:

```sh
Hello and Welcome to IPFS!

██╗██████╗ ███████╗███████╗
██║██╔══██╗██╔════╝██╔════╝
██║██████╔╝█████╗  ███████╗
██║██╔═══╝ ██╔══╝  ╚════██║
██║██║     ██║     ███████║
╚═╝╚═╝     ╚═╝     ╚══════╝

If you're seeing this, you have successfully installed
IPFS and are now interfacing with the ipfs merkledag!

Check out some of the other files in this directory:

  ./about
  ./help

  ./readme          <-- this file
  ./security-notes

```

You can explore other objects in there. In particular, check out `quick-start`:


```sh
ipfs cat /ipfs/QmYwAPJzv5CZsnA625s3Xf2nemtYgPpHdWEz79ojWnPbdG/quick-start
```

Which will walk you through several interesting examples.

## Going Online

Once you're ready to take things online, run the daemon in another terminal:

```sh
> ipfs daemon
Initializing daemon...
Swarm listening on /ip4/10.11.12.13/tcp/4001
Swarm listening on /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/4001
Swarm listening on /ip6/::1/tcp/4001
API server listening on /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5001
Gateway (readonly) server listening on /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/8080
Daemon is ready
```

<div class="alert alert-info">
Make note of the tcp ports you get. if they are different, use yours in the commands below.
</div>

Now, if you're connected to the network,
you should be able to see the ipfs addresses of your peers:

```sh
> ipfs swarm peers
/ip4/104.131.131.82/tcp/4001/ipfs/QmaCpDMGvV2BGHeYERUEnRQAwe3N8SzbUtfsmvsqQLuvuJ
/ip4/104.236.151.122/tcp/4001/ipfs/QmSoLju6m7xTh3DuokvT3886QRYqxAzb1kShaanJgW36yx
/ip4/134.121.64.93/tcp/1035/ipfs/QmWHyrPWQnsz1wxHR219ooJDYTvxJPyZuDUPSDpdsAovN5
/ip4/178.62.8.190/tcp/4002/ipfs/QmdXzZ25cyzSF99csCQmmPZ1NTbWTe8qtKFaZKpZQPdTFB
```

These are a combination of `<transport address>/ipfs/<hash-of-public-key>`.

More peers will connect the longer your node stays online.

Now, you should be able to get objects from the network. Try:

```
ipfs cat /ipfs/QmW2WQi7j6c7UgJTarActp7tDNikE4B2qXtFCfLPdsgaTQ/cat.jpg >cat.jpg
open cat.jpg
```

And, you can add objects to the network. Try adding one, and then
viewing it in your favorite browser:

```
> hash=`echo "I <3 IPFS -$(whoami)" | ipfs add -q`
> curl "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/$hash"
I <3 IPFS -<your username>
```

Cool, huh? The gateway served a file _from your computer_. The gateway queried
the DHT, found your machine, requested the file, your machine sent it to the
gateway, and the gateway sent it to your browser.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
Note: depending on the state of the network, the `curl` may take a while. The public gateways may be overloaded or having a hard time reaching you. If you use curl, then you get:<br/>curl: (7) couldn't connect to host</3>
</div>

You can also check it out at your own local gateway:

```
> curl "http://127.0.0.1:8080/ipfs/$hash"
I <3 IPFS -<your username>
```

By default, your gateway is not exposed to the world, it only works locally.

## Fancy Web Console

We also have a web console you can use to check the state of your node.
On your favorite web browser, go to:

> http://localhost:5001/webui

This should bring up a console like this:

<img class="screenshot" alt="Web console connection view" src="{{ baseurl }}/media/webui-connection.png">

Now, you're ready:
