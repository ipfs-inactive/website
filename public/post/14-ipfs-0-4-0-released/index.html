<p><a href="http://dist.ipfs.io/#go-ipfs">go-ipfs 0.4.0</a> has been
released! Among the many changes are a revamped implementation of the IPFS
communication protocols, increased performance, improvements to IPNS (the
Interplanetary Naming System), many bugfixes, and lots of new features to make
IPFS even more powerful.</p>

<p><img src="{attach}/images/fireworks.jpg" alt="0.4.0" /></p>

<h2 id="the-ipfs-files-api">The IPFS <strong>Files API</strong></h2>

<p>In 0.4.0, we&rsquo;ve added a new feature, the Files API, available through the
subcommand: <code>ipfs files</code>. This subcommand allows a program to interact with IPFS
using familiar filesystem operations, namely: creating directories, reading, writing
and deleting files, listing out different directories, and so on.</p>

<p>This feature enables any application that uses a filesystem-like backend
to use IPFS for storage without changing the application logic at all.</p>

<p>It is used like so:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">&gt; ipfs files mkdir /cats

&gt; ipfs files ls /
cats

&gt; echo bar | ipfs files write --create /cats/foo

&gt; ipfs files ls /cats
foo

&gt; ipfs files read /cats/foo
bar

&gt; ipfs files stat /
QmNU8HmaeRa8VtfqAoQRJhSE5Zx54vyYf2nT1bDGcYXaNv
...

# /ipfs/QmNU8HmaeRa8VtfqAoQRJhSE5Zx54vyYf2nT1bDGcYXaNv is a snapshot
# of this file system!

# You can see it locally or on the public gateway:
#  https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmNU8HmaeRa8VtfqAoQRJhSE5Zx54vyYf2nT1bDGcYXaNv

# Subsequent edits will produce a new /ipfs address for the root directory.
</code></pre>

<p>One great example of this is <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-blob-store">ipfs-blob-store</a>,
an IPFS-backed storage driver that implements the
<a href="https://github.com/maxogden/abstract-blob-store">blob-store-interface</a>, so that any app
that uses any other blob-store storage driver (S3, IndexedDB, LevelDB, etc) can now use
IPFS. <a href="https://github.com/diasdavid/registry-mirror">registry-mirror</a> uses this
approach to mirror the npm registry onto IPFS.</p>

<p>We are looking forward to seeing more use cases of this new convenient and powerful API.</p>

<h2 id="why-we-re-changing-the-protocol">Why we&rsquo;re changing the protocol</h2>

<p>The most important change allows IPFS implementations to use pluggable stream
multiplexers, such as <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/yamux">yamux</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/docker/spdystream">spdystream</a>, or
<a href="https://github.com/inconshreveable/muxado">muxado</a>. Instead of locking IPFS
permanently into a single multiplexer that won&rsquo;t work for every language or
situation, this change allows each IPFS implementation to implement the
multiplexers that they choose to, and then negotiate which to use during the
initial connection handshake.</p>

<p>This modularity with stream muxing makes it easier for certain languages to
improve performance. For example, the Go programming language may have muxado
and yamux implementations that are really good, but many languages lack good (or
any) implementations of them. Or take Node.js, which works well with
spdy-transport, and it would be nice to take advantage of that. And
then there are options like
<a href="https://github.com/maxogden/multiplex">multiplex</a>, which may not have the
same performance, but are much easier to implement.</p>

<p>So, by supporting as many muxers as we can, we get to choose the best
multiplexers for the job. It also makes it much easier to implement the IPFS
protocols in a new language. And of course, if a better multiplexers standard
comes along, it will be easier to upgrade IPFS to support it in the future.</p>

<p>The same code that allows us to easily select a stream muxer is also being
used to select which IPFS sub-protocol to use for any given stream between
peers. Now, if we need to make a breaking protocol change to any of those (like
the DHT or bitswap) we can do so seamlessly, and provide easy backwards
compatibility. We won&rsquo;t need to &ldquo;break&rdquo; anything because we will be able to
have nodes run multiple protocols at the same time for compatibility.</p>

<p>In addition to the multiplexers changes, the protocol revamp has also improved
efficiency and performance in a few important ways, including the elimination of
a double wrapping of the length prefixer, and the removal of some unnecessary
round trips between nodes.</p>

<h3 id="breaking-changes">Breaking changes</h3>

<p>This release contains a <strong>breaking change</strong> to the network wire protocol  in the
form of a major refactor and upgrade to the libp2p handshake protocol.  Because
of the refactor, <strong>all IPFS daemons earlier than 0.4.0 will not be able to
communicate with the newest version</strong>. It is strongly recommended that everyone
running an IPFS node upgrades to the latest version as soon as possible, as
these nodes will, after a certain time, no longer be able to communicate with
the majority of the network until they are upgraded. There are instructions on
how to update below.</p>

<p>Refactoring the protocol is not something to be done lightly. But at this early
stage, this is necessary to ensure we have the right design for IPFS in place
for the future. It&rsquo;s better to improve the protocol now during this alpha stage
of the project than when there are a lot more people running nodes across a
lot of different implementations.</p>

<p>One of the important changes that&rsquo;s been made to the protocol means that <em>there
should never be a breaking change like this again</em>. This is due to a change to
allow nodes to announce the version of the protocol they are using when
connecting to other IPFS nodes. The goal is to roll any future protocol changes
into the implementations gradually, so that we can still support legacy
protocols for a period of time, making it easier to deprecate old versions over
time.</p>

<h3 id="the-public-gateway-and-bootstrappers">The public gateway and bootstrappers</h3>

<p>We provide two essential public services to the IPFS community: the public
gateway at <a href="https://ipfs.io">https://ipfs.io</a> and the default bootstrap nodes. We&rsquo;re making sure
that despite the breaking changes, both will continue to work with 0.4.x and
0.3.x for a while. You can read more about the details of this in an earlier
blog post: <a href="../9-v04x-migration">Migrating ipfs.io from go-ipfs 0.3.x to 0.4.0</a>.
We expect to keep this grace period open until the end of April 2016.</p>

<h2 id="changes-to-the-repo">Changes to the repo</h2>

<p>We made a few changes to our on disk storage format (called the &lsquo;repo&rsquo;).
The way object pinning (<code>ipfs pin add</code>) works has also been upgraded to be much
more efficient, which will improve the overall speed of adding and downloading
IPFS data. Previously, when you pinned a file recursively, it would add a
recursive type pin to the root, and then add an indirect type pin to each child
node. This made enumeration for GC convenient, but was very slow and made a lot
of things needlessly complicated. We have switched to just adding the recursive
pin to the root object, and then doing the enumeration of child nodes when we
actually run a garbage collection.</p>

<p>Because of this change, you will need to run a migration (from repo version 2
to version 3). If you update with the <code>ipfs-update</code> tool, this will be done for
you automatically. If you updated manually, and did not run the migration, ipfs
will fail to run, and print a message saying that there is a mismatch in the repo
versions.</p>

<h2 id="other-improvements-and-fixes">Other improvements and fixes</h2>

<p>In addition to a major protocol improvement and upgrade, this release adds a lot
of new functionality, performance speedups, and stability fixes that make this
the best version of IPFS to date.</p>

<p>This release also includes performance and usability improvements to IPNS,
which is IPFS&rsquo;s mutability layer. IPNS creates a link from an IPFS node&rsquo;s
public key to the hash of an arbitrary objects hash, in a way that is
cryptographically verifiable. We call this &ldquo;publishing&rdquo; a hash, and you can try
it out using the <code>ipfs publish</code> command. By allowing users to change what the
pubkey hash points to, we provide users with a single hash they can give to their
users to get the latest version of their data. This creates a seamless way to
use IPFS to verify content, and to distribute content via trustless nodes in a
smart, safe way.  This brings IPFS closer to the goal of being a global
filesystem of data, that can allow everyone in the world to help serve the
world&rsquo;s data in a way that enriches and empowers everybody.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-upgrade">How to upgrade</h2>

<p>Depending on how you initially installed IPFS, there are several ways to
upgrade. If you installed IPFS with a pre-built binary, you can either head over
to <a href="http://dist.ipfs.io/#go-ipfs">dist.ipfs.io</a> and grab the latest version
from there. Or alternatively, from the same page you can grab the <code>ipfs-update</code>
binary, and use it to perform the upgrade for you. If you installed from
source, you can simply update your git repo to the <code>v0.4.0</code> tag, run <code>make
toolkit_upgrade &amp;&amp; make install</code>.</p>

<p>Please upgrade your IPFS nodes as soon as you can, so you can take advantage
of the improvements!</p>

<h2 id="changelog">Changelog</h2>

<p>This is a major release with plenty of new features and bugfixes.
It also includes breaking changes which make it incompatible with v0.3.x
on the networking layer.</p>

<ul>
<li>Major Changes

<ul>
<li>Multistream</li>
<li>The addition of multistream is a breaking change on the networking layer,
but gives IPFS implementations the ability to mix and match different
stream multiplexers, e.g. yamux, spdystream, or muxado.
This adds a ton of flexibility on one of the lower layers of the protocol,
and will help us avoid further breaking protocol changes in the future.</li>
<li>Files API</li>
<li>The new <code>files</code> command and API allow a program to interact with IPFS
using familiar filesystem operations, namely: creating directories,
reading, writing, and deleting files, listing out different directories,
and so on. This feature enables any other application that uses a
filesystem-like backend for storage, to use IPFS as its storage driver
without having change the application logic at all.</li>
<li>Gx</li>
<li>go-ipfs now uses <a href="https://github.com/whyrusleeping/gx">gx</a> to manage its
dependencies. This means that under the hood, go-ipfs&rsquo;s dependencies are
backed by IPFS itself! It also means that go-ipfs is no longer installed
using <code>go get</code>. Use <code>make install</code> instead.</li>
</ul></li>
