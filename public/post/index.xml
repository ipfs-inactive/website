      <description>dist.ipfs.io is the new distributions page for IPFS. This is the new one-stop-shop for finding and downloading all official binaries that the IPFS Team produces.
The IPFS Distributions Website The distributions website itself is served by, hosted, and distributed through IPFS. The website assets and all of the binaries form one large IPFS content graph. This means that you can view and use this website through any IPFS node, even your own local ipfs node.</description>

      <title>go-ipfs 0.4.0 has been released</title>
      <link>https://ipfs.io/post/14-ipfs-0-4-0-released/</link>

      <guid>https://ipfs.io/post/14-ipfs-0-4-0-released/</guid>
      <description>go-ipfs 0.4.0 has been released! Among the many changes are a revamped implementation of the IPFS communication protocols, increased performance, improvements to IPNS (the Interplanetary Naming System), many bugfixes, and lots of new features to make IPFS even more powerful.
The IPFS Files API In 0.4.0, we&amp;rsquo;ve added a new feature, the Files API, available through the subcommand: ipfs files. This subcommand allows a program to interact with IPFS using familiar filesystem operations, namely: creating directories, reading, writing and deleting files, listing out different directories, and so on.</description>

      <title>Migrating ipfs.io from go-ipfs 0.3.x to 0.4.0</title>

      <description>Good news everyone! We&amp;rsquo;ll soon release go-ipfs 0.4.0, which contains lots of great changes and enhancements. An upcoming post will detail the improvements of 0.4.0. This post is about important things to be aware of when upgrading. Users who already rely on go-ipfs or the ipfs.io services should pay special attention.
There are breaking changes which prevent 0.4.x nodes from communicating with 0.3.x nodes. We know breaking changes are painful.</description>

      <title>Stellar Module Management - Install your Node.js modules using IPFS</title>
      <link>https://ipfs.io/post/8-registry-mirror/</link>

      <description>Node.js Interactive, the first Node.js conference organized by the Linux Foundation, happened on Dec 8-9 of 2015. There were hundreds of participants, and dozens of really amazing talks divided in 3 specific tracks: backend, frontend and IoT.
I was fortunate to attend and present a project we&amp;rsquo;ve been developing at Protocol Labs, that builds on on top of IPFS, the InterPlanetary FileSystem.
You can learn about that project in this blog post, check out the talk slides or wait for the video recording of the talk.</description>

      <title>ipscend - Publish static web content to IPFS</title>
      <link>https://ipfs.io/post/3-ipscend/</link>

      <guid>https://ipfs.io/post/3-ipscend/</guid>
      <description>ipscend is a new tool to help developers publish their static web content to IPFS and share it easily, while keeping history and more. It is heavily inspired by previous static web content publishing tools, like GitHub Pages and surge.
Features Currently, ipscend offers a set of features, accessible through a CLI, and installable through npm (npm i -g ipscend), which enable a simple workflow for working in your Web page/app and publishing it to the IPFS network.</description>

      <title>Run IPFS in a Docker container</title>
      <link>https://ipfs.io/post/1-run-ipfs-on-docker/</link>

      <guid>https://ipfs.io/post/1-run-ipfs-on-docker/</guid>
      <description>In recent years, Docker and a few other projects have redefined how we run server applications. In the future, we might be running containerized apps in our personal devices. At its core, this fast-paced improvement is a combination of good interfaces to standardize how to do things, and great tooling to make using containers easy.
The IPFS Project has many things planned for the world of containers. The most interesting is using IPFS to distribute containers hyper efficiently across data-centers and the internet.</description>

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greetings Internet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post kicks off the official IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) Blog. This is long overdue&amp;ndash; the project is many months old. We will be making a series of posts explaining various aspects of IPFS, its development, our growing community, and so on. This blog will also be used to make all important announcements henceforth.&lt;/p&gt;
