### Report Copyright Infringement on the IPFS Gateway Service
Protocol Labs Inc. and the core IPFS team have adopted this copyright infringement policy in accordance with the [Digital Millennium Copyright Act](http://http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/legislation/dmca.pdf).

If you are a copyright owner, or agent of the owner, and you believe that content available on the IPFS Gateway Service infringes one or more of your copyrights please notify us by sending a DMCA Notice of the infringement containing the information below.    After we receive a valid and complete notice, we will investigate and block or otherwise make the material unavailable through the IPFS Gateway Service. Learn more about our process below.

The email address (preferred) and physical address (less preferred) of our Designated Agent to receive notification of claimed infringement is listed at the end of this policy.  Please read it carefully and make sure you are aware of the legal implications of the DMCA. You can be held liable for damages, including costs and attorney fees, if you materially misrepresent that material or activity infringes on your copyright.  We may highlight such abuses, too. Consult an attorney before filing a DMCA Notice if you are unsure whether your copyrights have been infringed, or if you unsure whether your materials were removed in error.

#### How do you file a DMCA Notice?
Your DMCA Notice must include all of the following information:

1. A physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner, or a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner;
2. Identification (URL) of the copyrighted work or material being infringed upon;
3. Description of the work or material that you claim to be infringing and would like to be removed, including information regarding its location (URL) with enough detail so that we can and verify it;
4. Your full legal name, mailing address, telephone number, and email address where we can contact you;
5. A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
6. A statement that the information in your DMCA Notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.

#### Where do you email/send the DMCA Notice?
The quickest way is to email it to abuse@ipfs.io. If you prefer, you can instead send it to:

    Protocol Labs Inc.
    Attn: IPFS Designated DMCA Agent
    427 N. Tatnall St. #51207
    Wilmington, Delaware 19801

Our Designated Agent’s telephone number is **+1 (302) 409-0239**

#### What happens after sending the DMCA Notice?
If the DMCA Notice complies with the above requirements, we will remove or disable access to the cited content that is allegedly infringing. We will make a good faith attempt to notify the alleged infringer of the takedown, with a copy of your DMCA Notice, using the contact information provided to us.

#### What happens if you receive a DMCA Notification from us?
If you believe your content was removed in error, you can file a counter notification with the information below (“DMCA Counter Notification”).

#### How do you file a DMCA Counter Notification?
Your DMCA Counter Notification must include all of the following information:

1. Your physical or electronic signature;
2. Identification (URL) of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled (the description from the DMCA Notice is acceptable);
3. A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled;
4. Your full legal name, mailing address, telephone number, and email address where we can contact you; and
5. A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which Protocol Labs may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA Notice or an agent of such person.

#### What happens after sending the DMCA Counter Notification?
If we receive valid DMCA Counter Notification that meets the above criteria, we will forward a copy to the person who filed the original DMCA Notice. If we do not receive notice within 10 business days that the person who submitted the DMCA Notice is seeking a court order to prevent the infringement of the content at issue, we will replace or re-enable access to the content that was removed.
