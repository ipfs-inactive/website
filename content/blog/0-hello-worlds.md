Greetings Internet!

This post kicks off the official IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) Blog. This is long overdue-- the project is many months old. We will be making a series of posts explaining various aspects of IPFS, its development, our growing community, and so on. This blog will also be used to make all important announcements henceforth.
