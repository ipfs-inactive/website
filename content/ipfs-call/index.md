## Welcome to the IPFS Weekly Call

Join us every week for the IPFS Weekly Call where we hear from the IPFS Community. Our calls start 17 UTC every Monday. We use zoom to host our calls and [this link](https://protocol.zoom.us/j/443621844) will directly bring you into the live video chat.

Before you join there are several points we would like to go over:

1. The IPFS calls are recorded and are put on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuhRWgmPaHtSGRSHdU9dbsukHKlihZZAe)
