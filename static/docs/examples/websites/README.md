#ipfs for websites
### A short guide to hosting your site on ipfs

Adding your static website to ipfs is quite simple! Simply turn on your daemon:
```bash
$ ipfs daemon
```

And add the directory containing your website:
```bash
$ ls mysite
img index.html
$ ipfs add -r mysite

added QmS8tC5NJqajBB5qFhcA1auav14iHMnoMZJWfmr4k3EY6w mysite/img
added QmYh6HbZhHABQXrkQZ4aRRSoSa6bb9vaKoHeumWex6HRsT mysite/index.html
added QmYeAiiK1UfB8MGLRefok1N7vBTyX8hGPuMXZ4Xq1DPyt7 mysite/
```

The very last hash next to the folder name is the one you want, let's call it
`$SITE_HASH` for now.

Now, you can test it out locally by opening `http://localhost:8080/ipfs/$SITE_HASH`
in your web browser! Next, to view it coming from another ipfs node, you can try
`http://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/$SITE_HASH`. Cool, right?  But those hashes are
rather ugly. Let's look at some ways to get rid of them.

First, you can do a simple DNS TXT record. In your domain's DNS management settings, create a new TXT record. In the Name/Host/Alias field, enter @ or leave it blank. Your other DNS records may indicate which you should use. In the
 Value/Answer/Destination field, enter `dnslink=/ipfs/$SITE_HASH`.
Once that record propagates, you should be able to view your site at
`http://localhost:8080/ipns/your.domain`. Now that's quite a bit cleaner.
You can also try this on the gateway at `http://gateway.ipfs.io/ipns/your.domain`

Next, you might be asking "well what if i want to change my website, DNS is slow!"
Well let me tell you about this little thing called Ipns (note the 'n'). Ipns is
the Interplanetary Naming System, you might have noticed the above link has
`/ipns/` instead of `/ipfs/`.  Ipns is used for mutable content in the ipfs
network, it's relatively easy to use, and will allow you to change your website
without updating the dns record every time! So how do you use it?

After adding your webpage, simply do:
```bash
$ ipfs name publish $SITE_HASH
Published to <your peer id>: /ipfs/$SITE_HASH
```

(Disclaimer: When using IPNS to update websites, it's important to think about that
assets could be loaded from two different resolved hashes when updating your website,
leading to outdated/missing assets unless accounted for)

Now, you can test that it worked by viewing: `http://localhost:8080/ipns/<your peer id>`.
And also try the same link on the public gateway. Once you're convinced that works,
let's again hide the hash. Change your DNS TXT record value to `dnslink=/ipns/<your peer id>` (note *ipns*),
wait for that record to propagate, and then try accessing `http://localhost:8080/ipns/your.domain`.

At this point, you have a website on ipfs/ipns, and you may be wondering how
you could expose it at `http://your.domain`, so that the Internet users of
today may access it too without them having to know about any of this. It's
actually surprisingly simple to do, all you need for this is your previously
created TXT record and to point the A record of `your.domain` to the IP
address of an ipfs daemon that listens on port 80 for HTTP requests (such as
`gateway.ipfs.io`). The users' browsers will send `your.domain` in the Host
header of the requests, and you have your dnslink TXT records, so the ipfs
gateway will recognize `your.domain` as an IPNS name, and so it will serve
from under `/ipns/your.domain/` instead of `/`.

So, if you point `your.domain`'s A record to the IP of `gateway.ipfs.io`, and
then wait for the DNS to propagate, then anyone should be able to access your
ipfs-hosted site without any extra configuration simply at
`http://your.domain`.

Alternatively, it is possible to use CNAME records to point at the DNS records
of the gateway. This way, IP addresses of the gateway are automatically
updated. Note however that CNAME records to not allow for other records, such
as a TXT to refer to the ipfs/ipns record. Because of this, ipfs allows to
create a DNS TXT record for `_dnslink.your.domain` with
`dnslink=/ipns/<yourpeer id>`.

So by creating a CNAME record for `your.domain` to `gateway.ipfs.io` and adding a
`_dnslink.your.domain` record with `dnslink=/ipns/<your peer id>` you can host
your website without explicitly referring to IP addresses of the ipfs gateway.

**Bonus:** To set up your site on a subdomain eg. `subdomain.yourdomain.com`, simply change the Name/Host/Alias field of your CNAME/A and DNS TXT records to `<your subdomain>`.

Happy Hacking!
