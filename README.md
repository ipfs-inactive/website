# ipfs.io website

This is a metalsmith template based website. generate it with:

```
make
```

Sometimes the auto-remake doesnt work because it only watches `src/`, so
if you change `tmpl/` just rerun `make`.

The output is in `build/`.

## TODO

- make this easy to publish with ipfs.
- make this easy to publish with ipns + dns.
